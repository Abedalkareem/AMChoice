## Usage

1-Add a `UIView` to your view controller and set the custom class to `AMChoice` .  

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Abedalkareem/AMChoice/master/help1.png"  width="450">

2-Set the images for select and unselect statuses *(You can set it programmatically also)*.

3-Creat a new model and implement `Selectable` protocol, by implementing `Selectable` protocol you must add three variables (`title`, `isSelected`, and `isUserSelectEnable`).   
```swift
class VoteModel: NSObject, Selectable {
  var title: String
  var isSelected: Bool = false
  var isUserSelectEnable: Bool = true 
    
  init(title:String,isSelected:Bool,isUserSelectEnable:Bool) {
    self.title = title
    self.isSelected = isSelected
    self.isUserSelectEnable = isUserSelectEnable
  }
}
```

4-Set the data (`Selectable` items) for the AMChoice view.
```swift
amChoiceView.data = myItems 
```

## More

You can make any customization to the `AMChoice` view, or you can implement the `AMChoiceDelegate` protocol to get the selected index, see the comment in the code below to know more.  
```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController,AMChoiceDelegate {

  @IBOutlet weak var amChoiceView: AMChoice!
  
  let myItems = [
    VoteModel(title: "Will smith", isSelected: false, isUserSelectEnable: true),
    VoteModel(title: "Al pacino", isSelected: false, isUserSelectEnable: true),
    VoteModel(title: "Abedalkareem", isSelected: false, isUserSelectEnable: true),
  ]
    
  override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
        
        
    amChoiceView.isRightToLeft = false // use it to support right to left language.
    amChoiceView.delegate = self // the delegate used to get the selected item when pressed.
    amChoiceView.data = myItems // fill your items.
    amChoiceView.selectionType = .single // selection type, single or multiple.
    amChoiceView.cellHeight = 50 // to set cell hight.
    amChoiceView.arrowImage = nil // use it if you want to add arrow to the cell.
        
    // you can set the selected and unselected image programmatically
    amChoiceView.selectedImage = UIImage(named: "selectedItem")
    amChoiceView.unselectedImage = UIImage(named: "unSelectedItem")
  }
    
  // get the selected item when pressed
  func didSelectRowAt(indexPath: IndexPath) {
    print("item at index \(indexPath.row) selected")
  }

  @IBAction func submit(_ sender: Any) {
    let selectedItems = amChoiceView.getSelectedItems() as! [VoteModel] // use getSelectedItems to get all selected item
    print(selectedItems)
    
     // use getSelectedItemsJoined to get all selected item joined with separator (if the selection type multiple)
    let selectedItemCommaSeparated = amChoiceView.getSelectedItemsJoined(separator: ",") 
    print("\n\n\nComma Separated: \n \(selectedItemCommaSeparated)")
  }
}
```

## Installation

AMChoice is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
